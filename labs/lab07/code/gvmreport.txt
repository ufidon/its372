NVT:    OpenSSH 'auth2-gss.c' User Enumeration Vulnerability (Windows)
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.813887
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 5.0)
Port:   22/tcp

Product detection result: cpe:/a:openbsd:openssh:7.7
Detected by: OpenSSH Detection Consolidation (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108577)

Summary:
This host is installed with openssh and
  is prone to user enumeration vulnerability.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Installed version: 7.7
Fixed version:     None
Installation
path / port:       22/tcp

Impact:
Successfully exploitation will allow remote
  attacker to harvest valid user accounts, which may aid in brute-force attacks.

Solution:
Solution type: WillNotFix
No known solution was made available for at least one year since the disclosure
  of this vulnerability. Likely none will be provided anymore. General solution !
options are to upgrade to a newer
  release, disable respective features, remove the product or replace the produc!
t by another one.

Affected Software/OS:
OpenSSH version 5.9 to 7.8 on Windows.

Vulnerability Insight:
The flaw exists in the 'auth-gss2.c' source
  code file of the affected software and is due to insufficient validation of
  an authentication request packet when the Guide Star Server II (GSS2) componen!
t
  is used on an affected system.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks if a vulnerable version is present
  on the target host.
Details:

Product detection result: cpe:/a:openbsd:openssh:7.7
Detected by: OpenSSH Detection Consolidation (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108577)

Summary:
This host is installed with openssh and
  is prone to user enumeration vulnerability.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Installed version: 7.7
Fixed version:     7.8
Installation
path / port:       22/tcp

Impact:
Successfully exploitation will allow remote
  attacker to test whether a certain user exists or not (username enumeration)
  on a target OpenSSH server.

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Update to version 7.8 or later.

Affected Software/OS:
OpenSSH version 7.7 and prior on Windows.

Vulnerability Insight:
The flaw is due to not delaying bailout for
  an invalid authenticating user until after the packet containing the request
  has been fully parsed, related to auth2-gss.c, auth2-hostbased.c, and
  auth2-pubkey.c

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks if a vulnerable version is present
  on the target host.

Summary:
The script consolidates various information for CGI scanning.
  This information is based on the following scripts / settings:
  - HTTP-Version Detection (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.100034)
  - No 404 check (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10386)

  - The configured 'cgi_path' within the 'Scanner Preferences' of the scan confi!
g in use
  - The configured 'Enable CGI scanning', 'Enable generic web application scanni!
ng' and
    'Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to directories for CGI scanning' within !
the
    'Global variable settings' of the scan config in use
  If you think any of this information is wrong please report it to the referenc!
ed community portal.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The Hostname/IP "win-pvniaep03l3" was used to access the remote host.
Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the "Enable gener!
ic web application scanning" option within the "Global variable settings" of the!
 scan config in use.
Requests to this service are done via HTTP/1.1.
This service seems to be able to host PHP scripts.

The User-Agent "Mozilla/5.0 [en] (X11, U; OpenVAS-VT 11.0.1)" was used to access!
 the remote host.
Historic /scripts and /cgi-bin are not added to the directories used for CGI sca!
nning. You can enable this again with the "Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to!
 directories for CGI scanning" option within the "Global variable settings" of t!
he scan config in use.
The following directories were used for CGI scanning:
http://win-pvniaep03l3/
